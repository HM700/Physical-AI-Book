# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book covers the fundamental concepts, practical implementations, and cutting-edge developments in the field of intelligent physical systems and humanoid robots.

## About This Book

This book is designed for students, researchers, and engineers interested in understanding and developing AI-powered physical systems and humanoid robots. Through a combination of theoretical foundations and practical examples, you'll learn how to build sophisticated robotic systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world.

## Book Structure

The book is organized into several modules:

- **Module 1**: ROS 2 Fundamentals - Learn the Robot Operating System and its role in robotics development
- **Module 2**: Simulation Environments - Master Gazebo and Unity for robot simulation
- **Module 3**: Isaac AI Framework - Develop perception and control systems using NVIDIA Isaac
- **Module 4**: Vision Language Action (VLA) Models - Implement advanced AI models for humanoid robots

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the content, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge (Python, C++)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with Linux operating systems
- Interest in robotics and artificial intelligence

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish a solid foundation in ROS 2, then progress through each module sequentially to build comprehensive knowledge of physical AI systems and humanoid robotics.
