# Glossary of Robotics Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book.

## A

**Actuator**: A component of a robot that converts energy (usually electrical) into physical motion. Common actuators include motors, servos, and hydraulic systems.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. In robotics, AI enables robots to perceive, reason, and act.

## B

**Balance Control**: The ability of a humanoid robot to maintain its center of mass within its support polygon to avoid falling.

## C

**Computer Vision**: A field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Robots use computer vision to identify objects, navigate, and interact with their environment.

**Control System**: The part of a robot that processes sensor information and generates commands to actuators to achieve desired behaviors.

## D

**Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**: The number of independent movements a robot or mechanical system can make. A humanoid robot typically has many degrees of freedom to mimic human movement.

## E

**End-Effector**: The device at the end of a robotic arm that interacts with the environment. For humanoid robots, this is often a hand or gripper.

## F

**Forward Kinematics**: The process of determining the position and orientation of a robot's end-effector based on the joint angles.

## G

**Gazebo**: A 3D simulation environment that provides realistic physics and rendering capabilities for testing robot algorithms.

## H

**Humanoid Robot**: A robot with a body structure that resembles that of a human, typically having a head, torso, two arms, and two legs.

## I

**Inverse Kinematics**: The process of determining the joint angles needed to achieve a desired end-effector position and orientation.

**Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)**: A device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body.

## K

**Kinematics**: The branch of mechanics that deals with the motion of objects without reference to the forces that cause the motion.

## L

**LIDAR**: Light Detection and Ranging. A remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances and create 3D maps.

## M

**Motion Planning**: The process of determining a sequence of movements that will take a robot from a starting configuration to a goal configuration while avoiding obstacles.

## N

**Navigation**: The ability of a robot to move through an environment, often including localization (knowing where it is) and path planning (knowing how to get where it wants to go).

## P

**Perception**: The ability of a robot to interpret sensory information from its environment, including vision, touch, and other sensors.

**Point Cloud**: A set of data points in space, typically representing the external surface of an object or environment, often generated by 3D scanners or LIDAR.

## R

**ROS (Robot Operating System)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior.

**Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT)**: A motion planning algorithm that builds a tree of possible configurations by randomly exploring the configuration space.

## S

**Sensor Fusion**: The process of combining data from multiple sensors to improve the accuracy and robustness of perception.

**Simulation**: The practice of using computer models to replicate the behavior of real-world systems, commonly used in robotics for testing algorithms safely and efficiently.

## T

**Trajectory**: A path that an object follows through space as a function of time, particularly important for controlling robot motion.

## V

**Visual SLAM**: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using visual input (cameras) to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of the robot's location within it.
