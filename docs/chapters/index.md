# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Chapters

This book is organized into comprehensive chapters that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of physical AI and humanoid robotics.

## Chapter 1: Foundations

The first chapter establishes the fundamental concepts of physical AI and humanoid robotics:

- [Lesson 1: Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics](./chapter-1/lesson-1.md)
  - Learn the basic concepts of physical AI
  - Understand the components of humanoid robots
  - Complete your first simulation exercise

- [Lesson 2: Robot Kinematics and Motion Planning](./chapter-1/lesson-2.md)
  - Explore forward and inverse kinematics
  - Understand motion planning algorithms
  - Implement kinematic calculations

- [Lesson 3: Robot Perception and Sensing](./chapter-1/lesson-3.md)
  - Discover different sensor types and their applications
  - Learn computer vision and LIDAR processing
  - Integrate sensor data for environment understanding

## Coming Soon

Future chapters will cover:

- **Chapter 2**: Control Systems and Locomotion
- **Chapter 3**: AI and Machine Learning for Robotics
- **Chapter 4**: Human-Robot Interaction
- **Chapter 5**: Advanced Topics and Applications

## Learning Path

We recommend following the chapters and lessons in order, as each builds upon the previous one. Each lesson includes:

- Clear learning objectives
- Key concepts and theory
- Hands-on exercises with code examples
- Practical applications
- Summary and next steps

## Multi-Platform Approach

Throughout the book, we emphasize a multi-platform approach, demonstrating concepts across different simulation environments:

- **ROS 2**: For standard robotics development
- **Gazebo**: For physics-based simulation
- **Unity**: For high-quality visual simulation
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: For GPU-accelerated AI applications

This approach ensures you understand how concepts apply across different platforms and can adapt to various robotics projects.
