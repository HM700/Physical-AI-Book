# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-05 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-11

## Vision
Create an accessible, hands-on learning platform for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics that empowers beginners and intermediate learners to understand and develop AI-powered physical systems through practical, spec-driven education.

## Core Principles

### I. Hands-On Learning
Every concept must be accompanied by practical exercises that allow learners to immediately apply what they've learned.

### II. Spec-Driven Development
All features and content must be driven by clear, testable specifications that ensure quality and consistency.

### III. Multi-Platform Integration
The curriculum must integrate ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and RAG Chatbot technologies to provide comprehensive coverage.

### IV. Progressive Complexity
Content must be structured to gradually increase in complexity, building on foundational concepts before introducing advanced topics.

### V. Interactive Learning
The platform must incorporate interactive elements, chatbots, and real-time feedback to enhance engagement.

### VI. Real-World Applications
All content must connect to real-world applications and practical use cases in humanoid robotics.
