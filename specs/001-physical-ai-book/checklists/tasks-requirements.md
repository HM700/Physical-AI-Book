# Tasks Quality Checklist: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

**Purpose**: Validate task completeness and quality before proceeding to implementation
**Created**: 2026-01-05
**Feature**: specs/001-physical-ai-book/tasks.md

## Task Format Compliance

- [x] All tasks follow the required format: `- [ ] T### [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- [x] Each task has a sequential Task ID (T001, T002, etc.)
- [x] Parallelizable tasks marked with [P] flag
- [x] User story tasks marked with [US1], [US2], [US3] labels
- [x] Each task includes specific file paths where applicable

## Task Granularity

- [x] Each task is atomic (takes 2-3 minutes to complete)
- [x] Each task has one clear acceptance criterion
- [x] Tasks are specific enough for LLM execution without additional context

## Organization & Dependencies

- [x] Tasks organized by user story priority (P1, P2, P3)
- [x] Dependencies clearly identified between phases
- [x] Parallel execution opportunities marked
- [x] Setup phase precedes user story phases
- [x] Foundational tasks before user story implementation

## Traceability

- [x] Each task traces back to book specification requirements
- [x] User stories mapped correctly from spec.md
- [x] Functional requirements addressed by specific tasks
- [x] Success criteria covered by validation tasks

## Completeness

- [x] Docusaurus setup tasks included (installation, configuration, deployment)
- [x] Chapter development tasks included (3 lessons with objectives, examples, exercises)
- [x] All content requirements from spec covered
- [x] Navigation and linking tasks included
- [x] Testing and validation tasks included
- [x] RAG chatbot integration tasks included

## Implementation Readiness

- [x] Tasks are actionable and executable
- [x] MVP scope clearly identified
- [x] Incremental delivery approach defined
- [x] All tasks ready for implementation phase

## Notes

- Tasks are complete and ready for implementation
